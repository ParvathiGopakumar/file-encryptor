Developed a program that encrypts a .txt file using a secret key initialized in RSA algorithm. This key is passed to decrypting program which
decrypts the file.
>Write new data in test.txt file
>First run the code in encrypt.txt file (copy it and run in main.c)
>And then decrypt.txt
>Tried to not explicilty mention the value of p and q in decrypt.C but couldnt
